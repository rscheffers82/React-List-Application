# React To-Do

A personal project used to sharpen my skills in `React` and `Redux`. This app lets you add tasks to a list and search existing to-do items. Completed tasks are automatically archived and can be made visible again with the Show completed select box. Prior to this version, data was stored locally in the browser. In the latest version, data is stored in Firebase. Authentication is through google OAuth.

### Any live example of this app?
I sure do! It's deployed on Heroku, just click [here](https://thawing-river-94231.herokuapp) to see it in action.

### So, how do I run this locally? I want to play around!
1. Clone or download this repo *
2. Open the folder in your terminal
3. Install dependancies with `npm install`
4. type `npm run start`

** <i>This project runs on a node server, please ensure [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed.</i>

### What about a test-suite?
That's included, just type `npm run test` to fire it up.
